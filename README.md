# REDESIGN A WEBSITE LANDING PAGE
Took an existing website landing page and redesigned it to improve usability and aesthetics. Design Decisions

1.Brand Identity and Header Replaced the generic heading with a custom brand name "ExampleCo" to establish a clear identity. Added a navigation bar ("Home | About | Services") to improve site structure and potential scalability.

2.Visual Engagement Introduced a hero illustration (a person with headphones and a laptop) to make the page feel modern and relatable. This imagery suggests tech-savviness and communication, aligning with potential podcasting, media, or service-based branding.

3.Typography and Hierarchy Upgraded the heading to “Welcome to ExampleCo” with a bold and inviting style. Refined paragraph text to improve readability while maintaining the original message from example.com.

4.Call to Action (CTA) Added a prominent "Learn more" button to guide user interaction and improve engagement. The CTA is placed logically under the intro text, styled with consistent colors for visibility.

5.Color Palette Introduced a soft red/pink theme to add warmth and personality while maintaining clarity and professionalism. Backgrounds, buttons, and header colors are aligned for a cohesive visual experience.

6.Layout and Spacing Used a two-column layout to balance visuals (illustration) with content (text + CTA). Employed padding and margin adjustments to ensure elements are cleanly separated and visually digestible.

Outcome: The redesign transforms a static placeholder page into a functional, visually appealing, and user-friendly web interface. It sets a foundation for future content expansion while maintaining a simple, approachable aesthetic.
